#' Calculates estimated phenophases for a set of common phenology
#' models as listed in Melaas et al. 2013. In particular it uses a
#' photoperiod constrain to account for changes in latitude instead
#' of explicitely changing parameter p0 (see paper).
#' 
#' @param data: a nested list of data with on location:
#' 1. the date (doy or long format)
#' 2. the temperature data
#' 3. the photoperiod data (NA when not needed)
#' 4. a vector or matrix with necessary constants (NA when not needed)
#'    - long term mean temperature
#'    - latitude
#'    - etc... 
#' @param par: a vector of parameter values, this is functions specific
#' @keywords phenology, model, sequential
#' @export
#' @examples
#' estimate <- SEQ1.3(data,par)
#' 
#' # estimate will be an estimated timing of a phenophase
#' # the format depends on the date as forwarded into the
#' # model
